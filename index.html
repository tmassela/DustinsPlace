            <p>Our Why.</p>

         <div class="tallcontainermobile">
            <div class="divleft">
                <h1>Our Story.</h1>
                <p>It isn't until you experience the death of a loved one that you fully grasp grief and the 
                    need for grief support.  Often times grief can be all encompassing leaving adults to try 
                    to put families back together in the midst of their own grief and children without the grief 
                    support they need. </p>
                    <p>Dustin's Place is named in memory of Dustin Cullen, a Believer who lived his life as a 
                    testament to God's grace.  Dustin loved  his family and friends completely.  He was the husband 
                    of Viki (Cullen) Brown and father of Caythan, Liliana, and Dean Cullen.  In 2016, Dustin was 
                    in a single car fatal accident leaving his wife, Viki, as a young widow alone to love for, 
                    care for, and attempt to put life back together again for their 3 young children at 6 years old, 
                    5 years old, and 11 months old.  </p>
                    
                    <p>While they were surrounded with love from their family and friends 
                    the need for grief support and care was evident.  Viki and her children attended a children's 
                    grief support group together and immediately felt the connection with other grieving families. </p> 
                    
                    <p>In October 2018, Viki along with some of Dustin's closest friends began the process of opening 
                    a children's grief center in our own community.  Dustin's Place was founded February 18, 2019.  
                    Dustin's Place will provide grief support through group meetings where children and their 
                    families can gather together with adults volunteers who through their passion have chosen to 
                    be companions to others during their grief walks.

                <h1>Our Mission.</h1>
                <p>The mission of Dustin's Place is to provide support in a safe place where grieving children, 
                    teens, and their families can find connection and healing through sharing their experience 
                    of the death of a loved one throughout their healing process. Dustin's Place believes that 
                    no child or family should grieve the death of a loved one alone.
