                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Dustin's Place was created in honor of Dustin Cullen who died in a single car 
                    accident on August 2nd, 2016.  Dustin was first and foremost a God fearing man
                    who loved his family and friends completely.  Dustin worked with children his entire
                    adult life at a residential facility and took great passion in the mental health of
                    children and adolescents.  After his death, Viki and their children Caythan, Liliana 
                    and Dean were left with a large void in their family.  Through an amazing grief 
                    they were able to grieve his death and now Viki, along with some of Dustin's closeset 
                    friends and family, have come together to open Dustin's Place, Inc.  The mission of Dustin's 
                    Place is to provide support in a safe place where grieving children, teens and their families
                    can find connection and healing through sharing their experience of death of a love one.  Our vision
                    is that no one should have to walk through grief alone.
